**🚀 ASP.NET Core MVC Project Management Web App**

🎉 This project showcases my journey of designing, implementing, and refining a database-driven web application that demonstrates the full potential of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

**🌟 Highlights of the Project**

**1️⃣ ASP.NET Core environment ✨**

This project was developed step by step, starting with setting up the ASP.NET Core environment and moving through:

- Designing the **database schema** and establishing **Entity Framework Core** relationships.

- Implementing authentication and authorization for secure access.

- Developing user-friendly views with Razor syntax and responsive layouts.

- Writing unit tests to ensure application reliability.

**2️⃣ Understanding MVC 🧠**

The application follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern, which ensures a clean separation of concerns:

- **Model**: Defines the structure of data and manages business logic. For example, entities like Project, Employee, and Task are designed to handle all database interactions.

- **View**: Represents the user interface. I created views using Razor Pages to display data dynamically and interactively.

- **Controller**: Acts as the intermediary between Models and Views. Controllers handle user inputs, interact with the Models, and return the appropriate Views.

This architecture allowed me to build a scalable and maintainable application while keeping the code organized and reusable.

**🛠 Key Features & Achievements**

**🗂 Database Management with Entity Framework Core**

- Designed relational tables for Projects, Employees, and Tasks.

- Configured code-first migrations for database updates.

- Wrote LINQ queries to interact seamlessly with the database.

**🔒 Authentication & Authorization**

- Implemented secure user authentication, ensuring that:
   - Only registered users can perform sensitive actions.
   - Admin roles have additional privileges, such as deleting projects.

- Password validation includes:
  - Minimum length of 6 characters.
  - At least one digit and one special character.

**🖥 Dynamic Views & Responsive Design**

- Developed interactive forms and tables for adding, editing, and deleting records.

- Enhanced user experience with jQuery UI components like date pickers.

- Used **partial views**and **view components** to modularize the UI.

**✅ Comprehensive Unit Testing**

- Wrote unit tests for critical functionalities using **xUnit**.

- Ensured all tests passed, providing confidence in the app’s robustness.

**🎨 User Interface Walkthrough**

**Home Page 🏠**

- Displays a summary of ongoing projects and recently completed tasks.

- Dynamic placeholders for interactive updates.

**Project Management 📋**

- View all projects in a sortable table.

- Add, edit, and delete projects securely.

**Detailed View 🔍**

- See a project’s related employees and tasks.

- Add new employees or tasks directly from the details page.

**🧩 Challenges Overcome**

- **Complex Relationships**: Designed a robust schema for managing many-to-one and one-to-many relationships.

- **Validation**: Added custom validation for fields like EmployeeNumber, ensuring proper formatting (e.g., ABC-123456).

- **Security**: Implemented advanced authentication and role-based authorization.

**💡 Lessons Learned**

Through this project, I gained:

- A deeper understanding of ASP.NET Core MVC and its powerful features.

- Hands-on experience with Entity Framework Core for database-first and code-first development.

- The ability to manage full-stack development independently, from setting up the database to creating an interactive front end.
